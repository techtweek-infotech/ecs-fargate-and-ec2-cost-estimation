ECS FARGATE vs ECS EC2:
-----------------------

With the EC2 launch type, clusters are constructed as a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. This provides control over the customization of your environment. However, 
while you can benefit from being able to configure your infrastructure to meet your needs.

With the Fargate launch type, you can concentrate on developing and maintaining your containerized applications. Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers. Instead, you 
simply specify the resources per task, which also improves security through application isolation by design. ECS then communicates with Fargate to launch, run, and manage the containers 
on your behalf.

The pricing for the EC2-based launch type is fixed to the memory and capacity provisioned for a chosen instance type. You pay for a full instance regardless of how much of it is being 
used by the workload.

ECS Fargate charges you by the CPU and memory requirements of your container, and how long it runs. You only ever pay for what your task uses.

Pricing Details for ECS fargate:
--------------------------------

Number of tasks or pods: 1 per day * (730 hours in a month / 24 hours in a day) = 30.42 per month

Pricing is calculated per second with a 1-minute minimum. Duration is calculated from the time you start to download your container image (Docker pull) until the task terminates, rounded 
up to the nearest second.

For Windows containers, billing is calculated per second with a 15-minute minimum.

Pricing Details for ECS EC2:
----------------------------

Amazon EC2 On-Demand instances (monthly) = 32.70 USD
EBS Storage Cost                         = 2.28 USD
Total monthly cost:                      = 34.98 USD
